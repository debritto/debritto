# 👋 Hi, I'm Christian M. De Britto  
### Sociologist • Knowledge Engineer • Research Software Developer  
### Creator of the DGT7 Method – Graph-Based Qualitative Analysis

I am a Brazilian sociologist (PhD) and Research Collaborator at the University of São Paulo (USP).  
My work integrates **sociology, theology, epistemology, and computational methods**, with a focus on:

- **Knowledge Graphs for qualitative research**  
- **Digital Humanities and biblical text analysis**  
- **Computational hermeneutics**  
- **Epistemology and Reformed philosophy**  
- **Social acceptance of emerging energy technologies**

I develop software, methods, and workflows that combine **Python, Neo4j/Memgraph, VSCode, CAQDAS workflows, and semantic graph modeling**.

## 🔬 Current Research
### **DGT7 — A Graph-Based Framework for Qualitative Factor Analysis**
A methodological and computational approach for:

- extracting, structuring and analyzing qualitative factors  
- building reproducible chains of meaning  
- loading textual knowledge into graph databases  
- integrating epistemological rules with data pipelines  

DGT7 includes:  
✔ Python processing scripts  
✔ CSV/TXT factor structures  
✔ VSCode annotation extensions  
✔ Neo4j/Memgraph import pipelines  
✔ Knowledge graph visualization tools  

(Documentation in progress → public soon)
